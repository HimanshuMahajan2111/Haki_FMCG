KEI Industries Limited an ISO 9001:2015, ISO 14001:2015, OHSAS: 18001:2007 accredited company, started 
production of Stainless Steel Wires in 1994. Since its beginning KEI has used state-of-the-art technology 
with strong emphasis on product quality and customer satisfaction. As a result of continuous improvement 
in every aspect of business within a short span of time, KEI has become one of the leading manufacturers & 
exporters of Stainless Steel Wires in Northern India. Continuous product innovation with regular upgradation 
of product process has earned KEI a reputed name in the domestic and international market. KEI exports its 
products to various countries like United Kingdom, USA, Mexico, European Countries, Africa, Australia and the 
far east.
KEI’s Stainless Steel Wire division has a manufacturing capacity of 7200 Mt per year ranging from wire diameter 
6.00 mm to 0.10 mm in various grades like AISI 304, 304L, 316, 316L, 302, 321, 304HQ, 302CHQ, 430, 
434 and Electrodes grades AWS 308L, 309L, 316L, 310, 312, 430L. These wires are available with different 
properties such as soft, quarter hard, half hard, ¾ hard, full hard, depending upon its final application, and 
surface finishes such as bright, matt, coated, decoated and as per customer’s specification.

can supply in coil as well as in cut 
length. The commonly manufactured 
grades are AWS ER308, ER308L, 
ER310, ER312, ER316, ER316L.
FILLER WIRE (TIG AND MIG)
KEI’s Stainless Steel Wires for TIG 
in straight length and MIG Wires on 
spools, layer wound, TIG & MIG Wires 
are supplied in clean bright and matt 
ER308L, ER309, ER309L, ER310, 
ER312, ER316 and ER316L.

0.800mm to 1.600mm and in weight 
spools upto 12.50kg. apx.
WHEN SHOULD I USE 308L, 309L OR 316L, 430L FILLER METAL?
308L (including ER308LSi) is predominately used on austenitic stainless steels, such as types 301, 302, 304, 
305 and cast alloys CF-8 and CF-3. For high temperature applications such as in the electrical power industry, 
the high carbon 308H electrode provides better creep resistance than 308L.
the cast equivalents of 316 and 316L, respectively.
Use 309L (including ER309LSi) when joining mild steel or low alloy steel to stainless steels, for joining 
dissimilar stainless steels such as 409 to itself or to 304L stainless, as well as for joining 309 base metal. CG-
or 316 applications generally require Molybdenum and 309L contains no Molybdenum.

TENSILE GRADES
The tensile grades of wires are:
• 1570 N/mm2 for wires of all qualities
• 1770 N/mm2 for bright wires quality B
• 1960 N/mm2 for bright wires quality B
These nominal values are lower limits of strength. 
The upper limits are equal to the lower limits in 
REVERSE BEND STRENGTH
This test applies only to wire of nominal diameter 
between 0.5 mm inclusive and 3.7 mm inclusive. 
For wires of nominal diameter less than 0.5 mm, the 
wire shall withstand without breaking the minimum 
radius of curvature for the supports for the various 
wire diameters is also given. If the tensile grade of a 
wire lies between two tensile grades given in Table 
3, then the number of reverse bends for the next 
upper tensile grade shall be chosen.
Note: The reverse bend test is not mandatory for 
wires to correspond with this international standard.
Note: Other tensile grades may be used on agreement 
between the manufacturer and the supplier.
