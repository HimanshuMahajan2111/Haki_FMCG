SOLAR POWER
Rapid urbanisation and globalisation has given rise to 
an increased demand for energy. The fast pace of 
depletion of conventional sources of energy have 
influenced us to find newer and sustainable solutions 
to meet this increase in demand. In such a scenario, 
renewable energy sources like wind and solar energy 
are the need of the hour .
Solar power generation has emerged as one of the 
most rapidly growing renewable sources of electricity. 
Solar energy is set to address the ever-growing need 
for power across the world. It has a low impact on the 
environment, serving as an ideal alternative to produce 
electricity, while maintaining a lower carbon-footprint 
and thereby helping preserve the nature. This has 
opened new avenues of business for the cable and wire 
manufacturing companies.
In the recent years, there has been an increase in the number of solar power generation plants, in India and across 
the world, which has in-turn created a higher demand for wires and cables. In response to this increase in demand, 
KEI is helping the renewable energy industry harness the opportunity.
KEI is proud to contribute to the renewable energy industry by supplying electrical solar cables to solar power 
plants. With a sharp focus on technology and innovation, the Company aims at becoming one of the key environment 
friendly technology companies of the country. To keep pace with the changing needs of the industry, it is important 
to overcome challenges, identify opportunities for growth and provide future-proof solutions for the industry.
