2 Details of sample received and tests carried out 
The sample tested was a 43.7mm diameter, 4 core cable comprising 4 off 70mm 2 insulated, stranded 
copper conductor with mica glass tape, filler rods, glass binder tape, bedding, steel wire armour and a black 
over sheath.  The over sheath had the following printed marking;

The test specimen was supplied by the client and received on 26 February 2013.  BRE Global was not 
involved in the sample selection process and therefore cannot comment upon the relationship between

Clause 11.1 - Fire alone (Category C)

the sample was conditioned as required by the test standard.
