ENVIRONMENTAL
AND RELIABILITY
ASPECTS
KEI abides by the rules and regulations of the Government and stays in-sync with the public 
opinion. Similarly, it keeps the environment as its first consideration while planning a new 
supply route. For instance, it uses the impeccable XLPE system which is an invisible system. It 
requires a very small area for installation and normally the land can be reused for its original 
purpose after the installation, resulting in considerable savings. Moreover, reducing the 
electrical and magnetic fields is also becoming important now-a-days. The cable systems are 
designed according to different magnetic field requirements and the external electrical fields 
are zero. With fewer accidental contacts or flashovers, these systems ensure better standards 
of safety to both workers and general public. Reliability of the network is also an important 
factor because the loss of supply results in high cost consequences. The EHV cable systems are 
less vulnerable to failures compared to the overhead lines.
HIGH STANDARDS
Partial discharge in the cables insulation is one of the main reasons for electrical breakdowns. 
Most of the recognized national and international standards permit discharges of max. 5 pC. 
However, our policy is not to allow deliveries of cables with any detectable discharges.

The optical fibres in power cables can be used for measuring the actual temperature along with the cable line or for 
data transmission. Fibre units are normally embedded under the lead sheath or between the screen wires.
The temperature monitoring provides continuous monitoring of cable temperatures, detecting hot spots, delivering 
operational status, condition assessments and power circuit rating data. Ideal for use in high voltage cables, it 
provides reliable temperature measurements and is immune to electromagnetic interference.

SELECTING A POWER CABLE
Different kinds of power cable construction are required to transport electrical energy from the power station to 
the consumer . The following factors are important when selecting a suitable cable construction:
 • Maximum operating voltage
 • Insulation level frequency 
 • Load to be carried
 • Daily load curve
 • Magnitude and duration of possible overloads currents  phase-to-phase and phase-to -earth
 • Connection between overhead and cable line (whether directly or via a transformator)
 • Insulation level of equipment (bare conductor insulators, arresters, etc.)
 • Voltage drop
 • Length of line
 • Profile of line
 • Mode of installation
   -  Underground (whether directly or in ducts)
   - In air (if in a tunnel, the dimensions and mode of ventilation of tunnel)
 • Chemical and physical properties of the soil
   - Whether rocky, sandy, clay or boggy, moist or dry
   - Chemical agents liable to cause corrosion 
   - The maximum thermal resistivity of the soil
 • Maximum and minimum ambient air and soil temperatures, bearing in mind nearby hot water pipes and 
  other factors liable to heat the cables.
 • Specifications and requirements to be met. The cross-sectional area can be calculated based on the   
             capital costs of the cable and its running costs incurred by the power losses in the cable.
The electrical properties and continuous current 
rating apply for Lead sheathed cable with our normal 
sheath thickness. The thickness of sheath and 
especially the cross-section of Copper screen can be 
adjusted according to required short-circuit rating of 
sheath or screen.
Where loading is cyclic, appreciable increase in 
current capacities may be justified. Refer to IEC 
publication 60853 for calculation of the cyclic ratings. 
In cable circuits having no magnetic saturating 
materials the positive and negative sequence 
impedances are equal and can be deduced from the 
tabulated effective resistance and inductance values 
corrected as required for frequencies other than 50 
Hz. 
Zero sequence impedance for solidly bonded systems 
can be roughly estimated as the sum of the resistances of conductor, sheath and a reactance of 0.05 to 0.1 ohms/km 
depending on the proportion of diameters of sheath and conductor at 50 to 60 Hz. For single point bonded systems, 
the zero sequence, impedance depends on the ground wires and any other grounded metallic objects along the 
cable route.
RATED VOLTAGE
The voltage which forms the basis for certain operating characteristics and test conditions is called the rated 
voltage and test conditions is called the rated voltages and is denoted Uo/U where 
Uo = The voltage between the conductor and earth or earthed metallic cover (Concentric conductor, screen, 
armoring, metal sheath) 
U = The voltage between the phase conductors

The permissible short circuit current of a cable is determined by the maximum permissible 
conductor temperature and by the duration of the short circuit current. At high peak currents, 
the dynamic forces between the conductors must be taken into account.
The short circuit capacity of the conductor and metallic screen of cable are related principally 
to their heat capacities and are limited by the maximum temperature permitted under short 
circuit XLPE power are 90 deg.C at normal operation and 250 deg.C at short circuit operation.

SPECS
THE
CABLE HANDLING AND STORAGE
1. Introduction
This directive describes the mandatory transportation handling and storage conditions for high voltage cables by KEI Cables. 
Failure to observe those instructions may cause a loss of warranty.
2. Transportation handling instructions
During transportation the following basic rules must be observed under all 
circumstances to avoid any damages to the drum and the cable. The 
pictogram shown below, which is also to be found at the cable drum, 
indicates the main rules accordingly.
 • Don't drop the drum, not even from small heights.
 • Securely protect the drum against moving.
 • Always use axle spreader when lifting the drum with a crane.
 • Use lifting equipment with appropriate lifting capacity.
 • Avoid mechanical stress of the wooden protection.
 • Place rubber mats underneath the drum when loaded onto a 
     trailer .
 • Observe high centre of gravity when loaded on a trailer .
 • Do not remove the fastening support of the drum until cable 
       pulling begins.
It's the duty of the freight forwarder to ensure a safe transport and to 
use intact equipment only.
Especially the following issues need to be carefully taken into account:
 • Height and width clearance of all roads, tunnels and bridges to be passed.
 • Width of the roads and sufficient load capacity.
 • Curve radii, inclinations, bumps, holes, tilt angles of the roads.
 • Sufficient loading capacity and braking force of the trailer and towing vehicle.
 • For ship transport: proper fixing of the drums to avoid falling from deck or being harmed by a storm.
3. Transportation and Storage conditions
It is important throughout the entire transportation and storage duration that the permissible ambient temperature of the cables on their 
drums is respected. The following table lists the permissible ambienttemperatures for different cable types on their drums.
In addition the following conditions must be ensured throughout the entire transportation and storageduration:
• The cables must be protected against mechanical damage, e.g. by wood lagging or Steel sheet Packing of the drums.
• The cables must be protected against direct sun radiation, e.g. by wood lagging or Steel sheet packing of the Drumsor kept under a 
suitable roof.
• The drums must always be standing upright; do not tilt the drums or lay them on their side.
• Store the heavy drums(>5MT) only on firm ground such as concrete or asphalt.
Note:
4. Cable laying conditions
During the cable laying process the cable temperature has to be within the permissible range to avoidany damages of the cable's outer 
sheath. In case the ambient temperature was not continuouslymaintained within this temperature range during 48 hours prior to the 
cable laying process, appropriatecounter measures have to be taken to ensure the correct cable temperature.
In case of project-related questions regarding above instructions please contact the responsible projectengineer for help.
Further and more detailed information may be provided along with the project-specific documentation.

CABLE LAYOUT AND SYSTEM DESIGN
The dimensioning of a high voltage cable system is always based on the specifications and demands of the project at hand. The following details are 
required for calculation:
• The type of cable insulation
• Nominal and maximum operating voltage
• Short- circuit capacity or short- circuit current with statement of the effect time
• Transmission capacity or nominal current
• Operating mode: permanent operation or partial load operation (load factors)
• Ambient conditions:
 -Type of installation   
 -Ambient temperature
 -Special thermal resistance of the ground
The calculation of the admissible load currents (ampacity) and the cable temperature is performed in accordance with the IEC publication 60287. At KEI, 
professional computer programs are in use for the calculation of the various cable data.
In initial approximation, the main insulation of a high voltage XLPE cable can be regarded as a homogeneous 
cylinder . Its field distribution or voltage gradient is therefore represented by a homogeneous radial field. The 
value of the voltage gradient at a point x within the insulation can be calculated as:
Ex= U
o/ rx . ln (ra/ri) (kV/ mm)
Uo= Operating voltage (kV)
rx= Radius at position x (mm)
ra= External radius above the insulation (mm)
ri= Radius of the internal field diameter (mm)
The electrical field strength is highest at
the inner semiconductor and lowest above the insulation.
(below the external semiconductor, r
x= ra)
1.1 ELECTRICAL FIELD
E
X
ri rx ra
The operating capacity depends on the type of insulation and its geometry. The following formula applies for all radial field cables : 
C = E
r/18 * ln (D/d) (µF/km) 
With Er= Relative permitivity (XLPE: 2.5)
D= Diameter over main insulation excluding screen (mm) 
d= Diameter over conductor including screen (mm)
Single-core high voltage XLPE cables represent an extended capacitance with a homogeneous radial field distribution. 
Thus a capacitive charging current to earth results in the following formula:
Ic= U
o.ω.C (A/ km) 
With Uo= Operating voltage (kV)  
ω = Angular frequency (1/s) C = Operating capacity (µF/km)
1.2 CAPACITY, CHARGING CURRENT
The operating inductance in general depends on the relation between the conductor axis 
spacing and the external conductor diameter . Practically, two cases have to be considered:
1.3 INDUCTANCE, 
INDUCTIVE REACTANCE
The operating  inductance for all three phases calculated as:
L= 2.10-4 ln (a/0.779. rL ) ( H/Km)
with  
a= Phase Axis distance ( mm )
r
L = Diameter of conductor over
inner semiconducting layer  ( mm )

The mean operating inductance for the three phases calculates 
for both cases as:

With
á=
 3√ 2.a Mean geometric distance ( mm )
a= Phase axis distance ( mm )
r
L= Diameter of conductor over inner semiconducting layer ( mm )
The inductive reactance of the cable system calculates for both cases as:
X = ω. L  (Ω/ k m)
With ω= A ngular frequency ( 1/s )
MANUFACTURING
UNITS
A large infrastructure, spread over an area of 2,49,576 sq. metres across three 
strategically located units, supported by state-of-the-art production units, gives KEI 
the strength to meet the varied needs of its wide client base.

1.4 DIRECT CURRENT RESISTANCE
1.5 LOSSES IN CABLES
OHMIC CONDUCTOR LOSSES
The losses caused by the skin effect, meaning the displacement of the  current against the conductor surface, rise approximately quadratic with the 
frequency. This effect can be reduced with suitable conductor constructions, e.g. segmented conductors
LOSSES THROUGH SKIN EFFECTS
The proximity effect detects the additional losses caused by magnet fields of parallel conductors through eddy currents and current displacement effects 
in the conductor and cable sheath. In practice , their influence is of less importance, because three conductor cables are only installed up to medium cross 
sections and single conductor cables with large cross sections with sufficient axis space. The resistance increase through proximity effects relating to the 
conductor resistance is therefore mainly below 10%
LOSSES THROUGH PROXIMITY EFFECT
2r
aa
a
High voltage cables are equipped with metal sheaths or screens that must be earthed adequately.
Sheath losses occur through:
 • Circulating currents in the system
 • Eddy currents in the cable sheath 
  (Only applicable for tubular types)
 • Resulting sheath currents caused by induced sheath voltage 
  (in unbalanced earthing systems)
The sheath losses, especially high circulating currents, may substantially reduce the current load capacity under certain circumstances. They can be 
lowered significantly through special earthing methods
LOSSES IN THE METAL SHEATH
LAYING INFORMATION

The maximum DC resistance values of conductors at 20°C are shown in cable standards. The DC resistance at other conductor temperatures may be 
calculated using the equation given below:
  R t= R20 [ 1 + α20 (t – 20°C)]
Rt = DC resistance at temperature t, Ω/km
R20 = DC resistance of conductor at 20°C, Ω/km
T = temperature of conductor, °C
α20 = temperature coefficient of resistance at 20°C, 1/°C
For Copper conductors   α20=0.0393  
For Aluminium conductor and sheath   α20=0.0403
For Lead alloy sheath   α20=0.0400 
Maximum DC resistance of conductors at 20°C (in accordance with IEC 60228/IS: 8130). Calculated DC resistance of metallic sheaths and metallic screens 
at 20°C
Voltage– dependent and current- dependent power losses occur in cables.
I) Voltage – dependent losses.
  Voltage- dependent power losses are caused by polarization 
  effects within the main insulation. 
  They calculate to:
  P 
d = U2oω  C tan δ  (ω/km)
  with Uo= Operating Voltage (kV)
           ω= Angular Frequency
Dielectric power loss factors tan δ  for typical cable insulations are:
  XLPE        (1.5 to 3.5) 10
-4
C= Operating Capacity (µF/km)
II) Current – dependent losses
  The current dependent losses consist of the following components:
  • Ohmic conductor losses
  •  Losses through skin effect
  • Losses through proximity effect 
  •  Losses in the metal sheath
The ohmic losses depend on material and temperature. For the calculation of the ohmic losses I
2R, The conductor resistance stated for 20O C (Ro) must be 
converted to the operating temperature of the cable.
Rt= Ro (1+ α(θ-20O C) ) (Ω/km)
With 
α= 0.0393 for Copper
α= 0.0403 for Aluminium
The conductor cross- section and admissible DC resistances at 20
OC 
(Ro) correspond to the standard series pursuant to IEC 60228/IS:8130.
Minimum permissible bending radii during laying:
 • During pulling of power cables, the bending radii should not be 
  smaller than the recommended values
 • In the case of single bends, the values may be reduced to a 
  minimum of 70% if the cables are carefully and evenly bent only 
  once before a termination 
  (around a pre-fabricated bow, if necessary)
Maximum Permissible pulling tensions during laying: 
 • During laying of power cables attention must be paid to 
  permissible tensile forces
Permissible tensile forces when pulling by cable pulling grip:
F = A x 15 N/mm
2
(Cable with Al-Conductor)
F = A x 20 N/mm2
(Cable with Cu-Conductor)
Maximum value in both cases is 40 KN
Maximum recommended tensile forces when pulling eye is attached to the 
conductor:
Al-conductor    F = A X 50 N/mm2
Cu-conductor  F = A X 70 N/mm2
Maximum value in both cases is 80 KN
A = Cross Sectional area of conductor in mm2 (without screen and conc. Conductor)
Minimum permissible cable temperature during laying:
XLPE insulated cable U> 30 kV; -5°C for HFFR and PVC-sheath, - 15°C for PE-sheath. At 
lower temperature the cables must be adequately warmed up beforehand. This can be 
done by storing the cables in heated room for several days or by means of special 
equipment.

XLPE - INSULATED CABLES DIRECTLY IN GROUND
XLPE-insulated cables can continuously be loaded to a conductor temperature of 90°c in underground installations. If a cable in 
the ground is continuously operated at this highest rated conductor temperature, the thermal resistivity of the soil surrounding 
the cable may in the course of time increase from its original value as a result of the drying-out processes. As a consequence, the 
conductor temperature may greatly exceed the highest rated value. Using single-point bonding or cross bonding instead of 
both-end bonding results in a considerable increase in the current carrying capacity.
When planning cable installations, care has to be taken that the cables and fittings chosen are capable of withstanding the 
expected dynamic and thermal short-circuit stresses. The dynamic stresses depend on the max. asymmetric short-circuit 
current and the thermal stresses on the mean short-circuit current.
SHORT-CIRCUIT CURRENT CAPACITY
Generally cables and their standard accessories will withstand the dynamic stresses under short-circuit conditions, but near the 
power stations it is important to take into considerations the dynamic short-circuit current capacity and to pay attention to the 
technique of installation.
DYNAMIC STRESSES
On page No. 10, the maximum permissible short-circuit currents for short-circuit duration of one second are given. These values 
are based on the following presumptions:
• Before short-circuit, the temperature of conductors - maximum 
 permissible temperature of conductor in continuous use
• Maximum permissible temperature of conductor in short-circuit is 
 250 DegC for XLPE Insulated cables
• The permissible short-circuit currents for short-circuit duration of 0.2  upto 5 seconds may be calculated by multiplying the 
 value of maximum  short-circuit current for short-circuit duration of one second by the figure 1/Sqrt (t) where t is the duration 
 of short-circuit in seconds
A)  Underground installation of EHV XLPE Cables
1.1)  Bending Radius - The minimum bending radius for EHV XLPE cables 
  is 20 X D, where D is the overall diameter of cable.
1.2)  Installation in ground - Underground XLPE cables are usually buried 
  directly in the ground. 
THERMAL STRESSES
Single core cables can be laid in flat or trefoil formation as shown in figures.
1.3)  Depth of laying – As a general rule, EHV cables are laid at a depth of 1 to 1.5 m. the laying depth is chosen depending on 
  obstacles in the ground e.g. telephone cables or water pipes. There may be more reasons for deeper laying, which then 
  mean a reduction of current carrying capacity.
1.4) Sand bedding - The cable shall be completely surrounded by well-compacted sand to such a thickness and of such a 
  grain size that the cable is completely protected against damage. The thickness of  sand bedding should normally be a 
  minimum of 10 cm in directions from the cable surface. Sand with grain size less than 8 mm is considered to give the cable 
  a good protection.
1.5)  Extra protection - Important feeders and cables at places where extended digging activity is expected can be further 
  protected against damage by means of tubes, slabs, troughs or warning tapes. Ducts of non-magnetic material for single 
  core cables can be mainly used at road crossing etc., the duct diameter should not be less than 1.5 times the cable 
  diameter . In trenches, normally extra protection is obtained by means of concrete slabs and its size is chosen according 
  to the expected damage. The slabs are placed directly on the cable sand.
1.6)  Back filling - Normally, the back fill consists of the material earlier excavated. However, bigger stones or pieces of rock 
  should be removed.
1.7)  Warning Tape - A pre-warning tape (yellow PVC tape) should be laid in the ground.
1.8)  Transportation - In order to avoid damage to the cable, the cable drum must be handled carefully during transportation. 
  It is very important that the cable drum stands on the flanges during  transportation, well fixed to the transport vehicle. 
  Loading and unloading should be made by crane or fork truck, not by rolling. Rolling of the drum should be done slowly 
  and carefully in the direction of the arrow on the drum.
1.9)  Cable pulling - During the pulling, the cable drum is normally placed  on jacks at the starting point and wire winch at the 
  other end of the trench. The pulling wire can be connected to cable either by a cable stocking or pulling eye to the 
  conductors in such a manner that water or soil cannot enter into the cable.
  The maximum pulling force for Aluminium and Copper conductor shall be as follows:
  For Cable Stocking 40 KN
  For Pulling Eye 80 KN
  The cable should preferably be pulled from the top of the drum. To prevent crossing of turns on the drum at sudden 
  pulling stop, a brake should be arranged at the cable drum and a man placed there to operate this brake, which must be 
  pulled rapidly to stop.
  To protect the cable from damage during the pulling out, cable rollers should be used and placed at suitable intervals. At  
  bends, angle rollers and guide rollers as required must be used in order to maintain the desired bending radius of the 
  cable.During the cable pulling, telephones or walkie-talkie should be used to ensure the internal communication. Once 
  established, it helps in preventing accidents and enables a safe pulling operation.
 B)  Installation of XLPE cable in air
  The requirement for bending radii, transportation and pulling of the cables are the same as for underground installation.  
  For fixing of the cable, the following requirements have to be taken into consideration:
Back filling
Back filling
Back filling
Cable fixing After laying of three Nos. cable, the cable shall be tied up with non-  
  magnetic metals trefoil/ single clamp depend up on the laying 
  configuration i.e., Trefoil/flat
Horizontal distance between cleats At 1 to 1.5 meter interval or as per customer's choice
Vertical distance between cleats If the cable circuits are laid in tiers then the vertical spacing between the 
  tiers should not be less than 300 mm

SINGLE-POINT BONDING OF SCREENS
One end of the cable sheath is connected to the system earth, so 
that at the other end (“open end”) the standing voltage appears, 
which is induced linearily along the cable length. In order to 
ensure the relevant safety requirements, the “open end” of the 
cable sheath has to be protected with a surge arrester . In order to 
avoid potential lifting in case of a failure, both earth points have to 
be connected additionally with an earth continuity wire. The SVL 
(sheath voltage limiter) is designed to deflect switching and 
atmospheric surges but must not trigger in case of a short- 
circuit.

CROSS
BONDING OF SCREENS
This earthing method shall be applied for 
longer route lengths where joints are 
required due to the limited cable delivery 
length. A cross- bonding system consists 
of three equal sections with cyclic sheath 
crossing after each section. The 
termination points shall be solidly bonded 
to earth.
Along each section, a standing voltage is 
induced. In ideal cross- bonding systems 
the three section lengths are equal, so that 
no residual voltage occurs and thus no 
sheath current flows. The sheath losses 
can be kept very low with this method 
impairing the safety as in the two- sided 
sheath earthing.
Very long route lengths can consist of 
several cross- bonding systems in a row. 
In this case, it is recommended to maintain 
solid bonding of the system ends in order 
to prevent travelling surges in case of a 
fault.
In addition to cross- linking the sheaths, 
the conductor phases can be transposed 
cyclicly. This solution is especially suited 
for very long cable lengths or parallel 
circuits.
TESTING PROCEDURE
AFTER INSTALLATION
(UPTO 400 kV XLPE CABLE)
Tests will be performed according to IEC: 60840, IEC: 62067 and SCECO-E-Specification.
DESCRIPTION OF TEST REQUIREMENT
1. PHASE CHECKING:
Correct phasing is verified by successively grounding individual phases 
and checking the corresponding phase at the opposite end using a 
Megger set at 5kV. The correct phase should be grounded with all other 
phases showing open circuit.
2. INSULATION RESISTANCE MEASUREMENT:
The Insulation Resistance is measured between the conductor at 5kV 
DC, and its grounded shield. This test is to be performed both before and 
after the DC High Voltage Test.
3. DC SHEATH TEST: 
A DC voltage of 10 kV is applied for 1 minute. This test should be 
performed after initial cable installation with the cable backfilled in the 
trench (where applicable) and finally when the cable installation is 
complete. No breakdown should occur .
4. AC VOLTAGE TEST:
The waveform shall be substantially sinusoidal and the frequency shall 
be between 20 Hz & 300 Hz. In particular cases, the minimum frequency 
can be reduced to 10 Hz subject to agreement between the purchaser 
and the manufacturer . A voltage according to IEC 60840/62067 shall be 
applied for 1 h, except in cases where this is not practicable.
5. CAPACITANCE:
Using a digital LCR Meter capacitance is measured between conductor 
and shield.
6. CONDUCTOR CONTINUITY AND CONDUCTOR DC RESISTANCE TEST:
With the conductors looped at the remote end, a loop resistance is 
measured successively between all phases. By simultaneous equations 
DC resistance for each conductor can be calculated.
7. CABLE SHIELD CONTINUITY AND CABLE SHIELD DC RESISTANCE 
TEST:
With the cable shields looped at the remote end, a loop resistance is 
measured successively between all phases. By simultaneous equations 
DC resistance for each cable shield can be calculated.

SCREEN BONDING METHODS 
SOLID BONDING OF SCREENS
Both ends of the cable sheath are connected to the system earth. With this 
method no standing voltages occur at the cable ends, which make it the 
most secure regarding safety aspects. On the other hand, circulating 
currents may flow in the sheath as the loop between the two earthing points 
is closed through the ground. These circulating currents are proportional to 
the conductor currents and therefore reduce the cable ampacity 
significantly making it the most disadvantageous method regarding 
economic aspects.

JOINTS
Joints allow the reliable connection of cables to each other .
Easier installation thanks to 
smaller dimensions.
Wide range of application with 
insulation diameters
Maximum operation reliability
with a metal radial moisture 
barrier as standard for all joints.
The insulation body comprises the 
semiconductive deflectors & middle 
electrode and the insulation 
compound. Thanks to a perfect 
combination of outstanding electrical 
and mechanical properties and 
excellent interface behaviour, silicone 
rubber (SiR) is used for the deflectors, 
the middle electrode and the 
insulation. To ensure proper 
functioning at all voltage loads and to 
guarantee a long and reliable life, the 
semiconductive parts are made of 
solid material. For optimal electrical 
stress distribution, the insulation body 
was designed based on computer FEM 
simulations. The extreme flexibility of 
the SiR ensures easy and fast 
assembling. The excellent elasticity of 
the SiR has an optimised level of 
surface pressure and ensures 
void-free contact between the 
insulation body and the cable. These 
advantages will remain constant over 
an extremely long service period.
All these features result in a joint that 
is highly reliable and will last a 
lifetime. For added quality, the 
insulation bodies are produced as a 
single piece, are prefabricated 
in-house and are pretested in our 
Swiss production plant.
Based on excellent experience with 
joints of our MP family, all main 
advantages of the pre-tested 
one-piece SiR slip-on bodies have 
been kept. As the most crucial 
element of the joint, design, material 
selection and production of the 
insulation body undergoes extensive 
research at Brugg Cables. As a result, 
the outstanding properties and 
long-time stability of the SiR were 
maintained and the electrical design 
was optimized.
