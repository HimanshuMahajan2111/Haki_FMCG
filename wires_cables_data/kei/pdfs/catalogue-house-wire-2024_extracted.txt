KEI’s innovative offering Conflame is ideal for wiring solutions in multi-storied buildings, hotels, 
hospitals, commercial establishments and residential complexes. It is shielded by a specially formulated 
flame retardant PVC compound. During fire, ordinary PVC emits black smoke and toxic fumes which 
are acidic in nature. This impairs visibility and hampers rescue operations. Conflame insulation retards 
spread of fire and emits minimum smoke and toxic gases. Thereby reducing the risk of injury. So, give

INSULATION: The bunched conductors are insulated 
with specially formulated FR PVC compound with a high 
insulation resistance value. The insulation process is carried out 
on modern high speed extrusion lines, which ensures high 
accuracy and consistency in performance. Flame retardant 
properties enable the cable to withstand overloads. The 
insulation is resistant to boiling water, steam and vapors. This 
prevents ageing and cracking in kitchens, bathrooms, damp 
walls and chemical industries.
MARKING: The cables are printed with generic 
marking ‘HOMECAB’.
