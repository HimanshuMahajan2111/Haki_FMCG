Cables
KEI Telephone cables are recommended for use in 
internal telephone wiring in high-rise buildings, oﬃces, 
factories, hotels, residential complexes, etc. 
KEI twisted pair cables are best suited for telephone 
cabling applications. The conductor is made of solid 
annealed, electrolytic grade high conductivity bare 
copper. The conductor is insulated with special grade 
high - density polyethylene with colour coding. The 
insulated cores are twisted with uniform lay to form pairs 
and are bunched together in such a manner so as to 
minimize cross talk. The cable is jacketed with a grey 
colour specially formulated Fire Retardant (FR) PVC with 
high oxygen and temperature index.

ANSI/TIA-568-C.2 having enhanced performance for 
transmission of high speed data signals on LANs. It also 
supports Gigabit Ethernet (1000 baseT) standard.
Improve Crosstalk Performance: Central spline 
separates pairs and maintains stable pair position.
Optimized Cable Balance: Improved balance of 
transmission performance for simultaneous parallel 
transmission protocols.

CCTV Cables
This CCTV 3+1, 4+1 construction cable is of hybrid type 
with combination of Communication and Electrical 
conductors. The 4 power cores enable powering of the 
CCTV camera. This cable used  for combination of 
communication and electrical supply to CCTV Cameras & 
due to its  composite component nature it allows CCTV 
installations tidy & provides lossless out . The 
communication cable (RG 59 Co-Axial Cable) is used for 
recording the images by the camera and to communicate 
with the data center. Co-axial cables are designed to 
transmit the complete video frequency range with 
minimum distortion or attenuation, making them an 
excellent choice for CCTV. The 4 number of wires in this 
CCTV cables are used for powering the cameras.
